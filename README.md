# Welcome!
Welcome to my github website page.
Here you can find my simple website currently built with HTML only. Still requires a lot of improvements.

# What is my plan?
The website is still a work in progress as my goal is to implement MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and React.

This will be my long-term project to familiarize what I have learned in class as well as learning to design with CSS.
Perhaps, use different libraries to create more sleek looking pages.
